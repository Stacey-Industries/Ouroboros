# Deferred — Items Not Yet Addressed

Items identified during the April 2026 deep analysis, reorganized into implementation waves by shared code areas, dependencies, and natural synergies.

---

## Wave 1 — Multi-Root & Lifecycle Safety

Fix the things that break when users actually use multi-window, and eliminate process leaks.

### Multi-Root Initialization

- **#13 — Context layer only initialized for one project root** — `initContextLayer()` called once with `defaultProjectRoot`. Secondary windows with different project roots get no context enrichment. Needs architecture refactor: context layer controller must support multiple roots or reinitialize per-window.
- **#14 — Codebase graph only initialized for one project root** — Same as #13 but for the graph. `initCodebaseGraph()` called once. Needs `GraphController` to support multiple roots or reinitialize when primary workspace root changes.

### PTY Lifecycle

- **#18 — `scheduleStartupCommand` 100ms race condition** — Hardcoded `setTimeout(..., 100)` assumes the shell is ready. On slow machines, the command arrives before the shell initializes. Needs shell-ready detection (wait for first prompt output) instead of a fixed delay.
- **#24 — `stopClaudeUsagePoller` doesn't drain in-flight PTY** — On shutdown, if `pollOnce` is mid-execution, killing the interval doesn't kill the spawned PTY. Becomes an orphan process.

### Hooks Infrastructure

- **#20 — Named pipe vs TCP fallback is silent** — On Windows, if the named pipe is unavailable, hooks server silently falls back to TCP. Hook scripts installed with a hard-coded named pipe path won't connect.
- **#22 — `hookInstaller` version cache is process-scoped** — SHA-256 computed once and cached. Hook scripts changed on disk while the app runs aren't detected until restart.

### Test Coverage (attach to Wave 1)

- **#89 — Hooks dispatch/session-inference/suppression** — The critical dispatch path in `hooks.ts` has zero test coverage. Only 3 smoke tests exist.
- **#96 — `hooks.test.ts` mocks 13 modules** — Closer to a type-check than a behavioral test.

---

## Wave 2 — Security Hardening ✓ (v1.4.0)

Closed plaintext credential and unauthenticated endpoint gaps.

### Credential & Auth Gaps

- **#2 — ✓ Move API keys from electron-store to `safeStorage`** — `SecureKeyStore` module created (`src/main/auth/secureKeyStore.ts`). One-time startup migration (`secretMigration.ts`) moves `modelProviders[].apiKey`, `webAccessToken`, `webAccessPassword` to encrypted `secrets.enc`. `config:get` IPC now sanitizes sensitive keys. `config:export` exports masked values. Extension sandbox `config.get` returns masked API keys.
- **#5 — ✓ IDE tool server + hooks server authenticated** — Per-session 32-byte random tokens generated at startup (`pipeAuth.ts`). Both `ideToolServer.ts` and `hooksNet.ts` require `{"auth":"<token>"}` as the first NDJSON line. Tokens injected into PTY env as `OUROBOROS_TOOL_TOKEN` / `OUROBOROS_HOOKS_TOKEN`. All 17 hook scripts updated.

### Trust Boundaries

- **#109 — ✓ Minimal workspace trust gate** — `workspaceTrust.ts` provides binary trusted/restricted mode. Restricted mode disables hook installation and extension loading. Trust persisted in `trustedWorkspaces` config. IPC handlers registered for renderer prompt/response.
- **#110 — MCP server sandboxing** — **Deferred to Wave 3** — requires `utilityProcess.fork()` infrastructure (same as #58/#61).

### Test Coverage (attach to Wave 2)

- **#90 — ✓ Extension sandbox** — `extensionsSandbox.test.ts`: 21 tests covering permission gates, config masking, path validation, safe globals, console proxy.
- **#91 — ✓ Web server auth + WebSocket bridge** — `webAuth.test.ts`: 30 tests. `webSocketBridge.test.ts`: 29 tests. Covers token CRUD, rate limiting, JSON-RPC dispatch, binary encoding.

---

## Wave 3 — SQLite & Process Architecture ✓ (v1.3.5)

The two biggest architectural debts — JSON graph and main-thread blocking.

### SQLite Infrastructure

- **#62 — ✓ SQLite migration framework** — `storage/database.ts` provides WAL-mode primitives with `PRAGMA user_version` schema versioning. `storage/migrate.ts` runs one-time JSON→SQLite migrations for graph store, thread store, and cost history. Non-destructive (`.json.bak` on success).
- **#60 — ✓ Graph migrated to SQLite** — `graphStore.ts` rewritten with `better-sqlite3` (prepared statements, transactions, indexed queries). `graphStoreMemory.ts` kept for worker-thread scratch pad. `graphStoreTypes.ts` defines `IGraphStore` interface shared by both implementations.

### Main-Thread Unblocking

- **#61 / #114 — ✓ Dedicated PtyHost process** — `utilityProcessHost.ts` provides generic lifecycle wrapper around `utilityProcess.fork()` with typed IPC, request/response correlation, crash detection, and auto-restart. `ptyHost/` subtree implements spawn/write/resize/kill/getCwd/shellState via the host. Gated by `usePtyHost` config flag (default false). Crash recovery sends `pty:disconnected:${id}` with preserved scrollback.
- **#58 — ✓ ExtensionHost process** — `extensionHost/` subtree runs extension `vm` sandbox in a dedicated utility process. Supports activate/deactivate, config snapshot updates, files/terminal API calls relayed back to main, command registration, and crash recovery with automatic re-activation. Gated by `useExtensionHost` config flag.
- **#110 — ✓ MCP server sandboxing** — `mcpHost/` subtree runs the internal MCP HTTP/SSE server in a dedicated utility process. Tool list and tool call requests dispatched back to main via parentPort. Gated by `useMcpHost` config flag. (Deferred from Wave 2.)
- **#68 — ✓ PTY batchers unified** — `ptyBatcherCore.ts` provides a generic per-session 16ms batcher parameterized by transport. `ptyElectronBatcher.ts` and `web/ptyBatcher.ts` are now thin wrappers (~40 lines each) over the shared core. Behavioral drift eliminated.

### Test Coverage (attach to Wave 3)

- **#93 — ✓ PTY and host tests** — `pty.test.ts`, `utilityProcessHost.test.ts`, `ptyHostMain.test.ts`, `extensionHostMain.test.ts`, `extensionHostProxy.test.ts`, `mcpHostMain.test.ts`, `mcpHostProxy.test.ts` added. `TerminalDisconnectedBanner.test.tsx` covers the crash-recovery UI.

---

## Wave 4 — UI Architecture & Accessibility ✓ (v1.3.6)

Prop drilling, memoization, focus management, and the unified rendering initiative.

### AgentChat Performance

- **#71 — ✓ `AgentChatConversation` 51-prop interface eliminated** — Zustand store (`agentChatStore.ts`) with selector hooks replaces all prop threading. Per-workspace scoping via `AgentChatStoreContext`. Consumers use `useAgentChatThread()`, `useAgentChatActions()`, etc.
- **#73 — ✓ `buildModel` memoization automated** — React Compiler (`babel-plugin-react-compiler@1.0.0`) installed and wired into `electron.vite.config.ts`. Auto-memoizes all component/hook returns — eliminates the cascading re-render from `buildModel` and makes 1,177 manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` calls redundant (progressive removal is future work).

### Chat Rendering

- **#74 — ✓ Dual tool rendering paths unified** — `AgentChatStreamingMessage.tsx` deleted. All messages (streaming + persisted) render through `AssistantBlocksContent` in `AgentChatMessageComponents.messages.tsx` → `AgentChatBlockRenderer` → `AgentChatToolGroup`. Duplicated `TOOL_SUMMARIES`, `categorizeTools`, `buildRenderItems`, inline `ToolGroup` all removed. `react-markdown` replaced by Streamdown (`streamdown@2.5.0`) in `MessageMarkdown.tsx` for per-block memoization and streaming-aware rendering. `PendingStreamingView` simplified to `StreamingStatusMessage` (no longer wraps the deleted component).

### Focus & Accessibility

- **#76 — ✓ Focus ring implemented** — `focusRingStyle()` returns `boxShadow: inset 0 0 0 2px var(--interactive-focus)` for the focused panel. `pfs` in `AppLayout` wired to real implementation via `useFocusPanel()`.
- **#87 — ✓ Skip-to-content link added** — Visually hidden `<a href="#editor-main">Skip to editor</a>` as first child of `AppLayout`. Visible on Tab focus.
- **#88 — ✓ Focus-visible and accessibility media queries** — `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` catch-all disables all animations/transitions. `prefers-contrast: more` increases focus ring to 3px white. Ctrl+1-4 now moves real DOM focus via `focusPanelElement()` with `data-panel` selectors on all four panel containers.

### Renderer Cleanup

- **#77 — ✓ LSP diagnostics wired to file tree** — `useLspDiagnosticsSync` hook subscribes to `lsp:diagnostics:push` IPC, computes worst severity, feeds `fileTreeStore.updateDiagnostics()`. Mounted in `InnerApp`. TODO comment removed.
- **#80 — Already resolved (pre-Wave 4)** — `FileViewerManager.internal.ts` is 286 lines after prior splits. No further action needed.

### Test Coverage (attach to Wave 4)

- **#92 — ✓ Window manager tests** — `windowManagerHelpers.test.ts` (23 tests) covers all pure helpers. `windowManager.test.ts` (43 tests) covers create/get/close/focus/persist/restore lifecycle with full mock infrastructure. Module-level state isolation via `vi.resetModules()`.

---

## Wave 5 — Competitive Feature Parity (Context & Completions) ✓ (v1.3.7)

Shipped @-mention enhancements, semantic codebase search with local+Voyage providers, tiered budget enforcement, and open-tab context for inline completions.

### Context Injection

- **#100 — ✓ @-mention context injection in chat** — Fuse.js fuzzy picker with `@file`, `@folder`, `@diff`, `@terminal`, `@symbol`, `@codebase` mention types. `MentionItem` extended with optional `startLine`/`endLine`/`symbolType` for symbol ranges. `symbol:graphSearch` IPC handler queries `graphStore.getNodesByType()`. Critical fix: `useAgentChatContext.ts` now merges `mentions[]` into `filePaths` at send time (previously dropped). `TaskRequestContextSelection.userSelectedRanges?` carries line-range data for symbol mentions through to `deriveSnippetCandidates`.
- **#102 — ✓ Semantic codebase search (vector embeddings)** — Full SQLite-backed vector store (`embeddings.db` with BLOB vectors), brute-force cosine search, AST-aware chunker using graph node boundaries with fixed-window fallback. Dual provider support: local ONNX (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384 dims, ~17ms/embedding, $0 cost) and Voyage AI (`voyage-code-3`, 1024 dims, higher quality). Hybrid retrieval via reciprocal rank fusion (`embeddingSearch.fuseResults`). `@codebase` is a special mention (flag semantics) — search runs at send time against the full message.
- **#117 — ✓ Cross-session persistent embedding index** — SQLite persistence at `{projectRoot}/.ouroboros/embeddings.db`, content-hash deduplication (`hasChunkHash`), `model` column enables invalidation on provider switch. Incremental reindex only embeds chunks with changed content hashes.
- **#65 — ✓ Budget enforcement reformed** — Two-pass tiered allocation: Tier 1 (user_selected/pinned) capped at 60%, Tier 2+ guaranteed remainder. `getFileTier()` classifies ranked files by top reason kind. Snippets sort by relevance-per-token ratio (score/estimatedTokens) instead of ascending length. `truncateToSignatures()` preserves head+tail for oversized files. `ContextBudgetSummary.tierAllocation` exposes per-tier bytes for transparency. 5 regression tests cover "large file doesn't crowd out small", tier-1 guaranteed allocation, tier-1 cap, structure-preserving truncation, and backward compat.

### Inline Completions

- **#99 — ✓ Inline ghost text — Phase 4 context enrichment** — Already production-ready in v1.3.6. This wave completed the deferred Phase 4: `editorRegistry.getOpenFilePaths()` exports mounted-editor paths. `monacoInlineCompletions.buildOpenTabContext()` populates `openTabContext` with first 50 lines of up to 5 open tabs (excluding current file). `aiHandlers.buildFimPrompt()` prepends `Context from open files:` section before the FIM tags when tabs are present. Completions are now context-aware across open files (e.g., suggests imports from open tabs).

### Embedding Infrastructure

- **Provider system** — `IEmbeddingProvider` interface with `embed(texts, inputType?)` supporting document vs query distinction (Voyage optimization). Three implementations: `createLocalOnnxProvider()`, `createVoyageProvider(apiKey)`, `createStubProvider()` (tests).
- **IPC handlers** — `embedding:search`, `embedding:status`, `embedding:reindex`. Provider cached by `provider:hasKey` combo so Settings changes hot-swap without restart.
- **Settings UI** — `GeneralSemanticSearchSubsection` in Settings → General after LSP: enable toggle, provider dropdown (local/voyage), conditional API key input, live index status display, reindex button. Config keys: `embeddingsEnabled`, `embeddingProvider`, `voyageApiKey`.
- **Spike** — `spike/embedding-spike.ts` tests all three paths (Voyage API, Anthropic pseudo-embeddings, local ONNX). Quality test runs 4 semantic queries against real source files and verifies top-1 ranking matches expectations. Runnable via `spike/run-spike.ps1` (PowerShell) or `bash spike/run-spike.sh`.

### Test Coverage

- **26 embedding tests** — store (9), chunker (6), provider (5), indexer (3), search (3).
- **5 budget enforcement regression tests** added to `contextPacketBuilder.test.ts`.
- **6 reason-to-range tests** in new `contextPacketBuilderReasons.test.ts`.

## Wave 6 — Multi-Agent & Workflow ✓ (v1.3.8)

Background agents, parallel conflict detection, checkpoints, spec workflows.

**Spec:** `plan/wave6-spec.md` — full phased plan for option 1 (dependency-ordered full wave).

### Completed items

- **#106 — ✓ In-editor hunk gutter** — `useEditorHunkDecorations` + `EditorHunkGutterActions` widget in `MonacoEditorInstance`. Accept/reject per hunk without opening DiffReview panel. CSS tokens in `editor-hunk.css`. Alt+Y / Alt+N keybindings.
- **#108 — ✓ /spec slash command** — `specScaffold.ts` IPC handler writes `{requirements,design,tasks}.md` under `.ouroboros/specs/<slug>/`. Templates in `src/main/templates/spec/` (copied to `out/main/templates/spec/` at build time). Collision detection and toast on duplicate.
- **#107 — ✓ Session checkpoint timeline** — Per-turn auto-snapshots via `chatOrchestrationBridgeGit.ts`. `checkpointStore.ts` queries thread-scoped checkpoints. `RewindButton` on assistant messages. `TimeTravelPanel` extended with `scope: 'thread'` view. Git ref convention: `refs/ouroboros/checkpoints/<threadId>`.
- **#103 — ✓ Background agent queue** — `backgroundJobs/` subsystem: `jobStore` (SQLite `background_jobs` table), `jobScheduler` (concurrency cap 2, queue cap 50), `jobRunner` (PTY-based, session correlation). `BackgroundJobsPanel` with status pill + cancel. OS notification on completion.
- **#116 — ✓ Streaming inline edit** — `useStreamingInlineEdit` hook on `ai:streamInlineEdit:<requestId>` channel. Token batching, ghost decoration, single-undo via `pushStackElement`. Feature-flagged via `config.streamingInlineEdit`; flag mirrored to `window.__streamingInlineEdit__` by `useStreamingInlineEditFlag`.
- **#104 — ✓ Parallel agent conflict detection** — `conflictMonitor.ts` debounced 200ms, pairwise symbol intersection via `graphQuery.detectChangesForSession`. `AgentConflictBanner` inline in affected chat threads. Severity: `blocking` (symbol overlap) / `warning` (file-only, graph cold).
- **#95 — ✓ E2E coverage** — Playwright specs: `agent-launch`, `diff-gutter`, `spec-scaffold`, `checkpoint-restore`, `conflict-banner`. Mock `claude` binary (`e2e/mocks/mockClaudeBin.*`). Fixture creates throwaway git-initialized project in `%TEMP%`.

**Slicing alternatives** (evaluated 2026-04-13):

- **Option 2 — Quick-wins slice:** #106 (re-scoped to in-editor gutter actions; panel-level hunk accept/reject already shipped) + #108 (`/spec` slash command — existing infra, new entry only). ~2 weeks. Independent phases. Pick when cadence pressure outweighs architectural investment.
- **Option 3 — Agent-core bundle:** #103 + #104 only. ~4–7 weeks. Largest infra lift but unblocks #115 (persistent terminals) via shared PtyHost+SQLite pattern. Pick when the dominant user pain is "queue a long task and walk away" — the combo is only meaningful end-to-end.

**Pre-spec discoveries worth noting:**

- **#106 is already hunk-level** in `DiffReview/HunkView.tsx` with per-hunk `stageHunk`/`revertHunk` IPC. Remaining gap is in-editor gutter UX, not hunk granularity.
- **#107 largely exists** — `TimeTravelPanel`, `git:snapshot`/`git:restoreSnapshot`, `captureHeadHash` in `chatOrchestrationBridgeGit.ts`. Wave 6 work is auto-snapshot triggers + thread-scoped timeline, not greenfield.
- **#108 slash-command infra exists** in `SlashCommandMenu.tsx` + `AgentChatComposerSupport.ts`. Adding `/spec` is a new entry + scaffold handler, not a subsystem.
- **#103/#104/#116** are greenfield — no queue, no cross-session tracking, no token-streaming inline edit exists.

### Agent Management

- **#103 — ✓ Background/async agent mode** — `backgroundJobs/` subsystem with SQLite persistence, concurrency cap, PTY-based runner. See completed items above.
- **#104 — ✓ Parallel agent conflict detection** — `conflictMonitor.ts` + `AgentConflictBanner`. See completed items above.

### Workflow Features

- **#107 — ✓ Session checkpoint/rewind** — Per-turn git snapshots on `refs/ouroboros/checkpoints/<threadId>`. See completed items above.
- **#108 — ✓ Spec-driven workflow scaffolding** — `/spec` slash command + `specScaffold.ts` IPC handler. See completed items above.

### Diff & Edit Visibility

- **#106 — ✓ In-editor hunk gutter** — `EditorHunkGutterActions` widget; re-scoped from whole-file to gutter UX (panel-level was already shipped). See completed items above.
- **#116 — ✓ Streaming inline edit** — `useStreamingInlineEdit` + `ai:streamInlineEdit` channel. Feature-flagged. See completed items above.

### Test Coverage (attach to Wave 6)

- **#95 — ✓ E2E coverage** — Playwright specs for all five key flows. Mock claude binary for hermetic tests. See completed items above.

## Items Requiring Runtime Measurement / Manual Testing

These need runtime profiling, manual testing, or tooling output — not code changes.

### Performance Measurements

- **Cold startup time** — No baseline. Target: <2.0s. Requires `perfMetrics.ts` instrumentation + Electron DevTools timeline.
- **Memory baseline (idle)** — Unknown. Target: <400MB. Requires Chrome DevTools heap snapshot.
- **Memory per terminal session** — Unknown. Target: <50MB. *(Feed into Wave 3 — confirms #61 priority.)*
- **Chat first-token display latency** — Unknown. Target: <300ms.
- **Graph full-index wall time** — Estimated 15-20s for 1,286 files. Needs measurement.
- **Graph JSON serialize/deserialize cost** — Theoretical O(n) bottleneck. Need to time on actual `.ouroboros/graph.json`. *(Feed into Wave 3 — confirms #60 priority.)*
- **Bundle size regression baseline** — No automated gate. Run `ANALYZE=true npm run build`.
- **Renderer re-render frequency** — React DevTools Profiler needed for AgentChatConversation and AgentMonitorManager. *(Feed into Wave 4 — confirms #71/#73 severity.)*
- **Approval response perceived latency** — Theoretical ~500ms from poll interval.

### Security (Need Active Testing)

- **Extension sandbox escape paths** — Need proof-of-concept extension testing `this.constructor.constructor('return process')()`.
- **Web mode full attack surface** — WebSocket auth, SPA token injection, rate limiting. Needs pen test.
- **CSP effectiveness in production** — Verify `onHeadersReceived` CSP overrides `index.html` meta tag (CSP is additive).

### Multi-Window Regression Testing

- **OAuth login in window 2+** — Fixed in code (`event.sender` instead of captured `win`). Needs manual verification.
- **Context layer per-window** — Confirmed limitation. Needs manual test with two different project roots.
- **Graph per-window** — Same as context layer.

### Dependency Analysis

- **`npm audit` output** — Need to run for known vulnerabilities.
- **xterm addon version alignment** — All `@xterm/*` use `^`. Need to verify compatible resolution.
- **`@anthropic-ai/sdk` usage verification** — May be types-only; needs grep confirmation.
- **pdfjs-dist bundle impact** — ~5-10MB. Verify lazy-loading.
- **Native addon rebuild consistency** — Verify Electron 41 ABI on all platforms.

### IPC Surface Area

- **Full 125-channel audit** — Only ~40 channels deeply analyzed. ~85 remain.
- **`claudeMd:*` handlers** — Verify path validation on CLAUDE.md generation.
- **`graphHandlers.ts`** — Verify no renderer-supplied path can redirect graph queries.

### Router Accuracy

- **Classifier accuracy metrics** — No precision/recall data. Evaluate against `router-decisions.jsonl`.
- **Retrain trigger safety** — Verify validation catches degraded weights. (Backup file now exists from Phase 1 fix.)

### Accessibility

- **Screen reader testing** — ARIA roles added in Phase 4 but not tested with NVDA/VoiceOver.
- **Keyboard-only navigation within panels** — Ctrl+1-4 works. Within-panel navigation unverified.
- **High contrast / reduced motion** — No `prefers-reduced-motion` or `prefers-contrast` support.
- **Large font / zoom behavior** — Verify at 150% and 200%.
