/**
 * internalMcpRoutingPolicy.ts — Wave 51 Phase C.
 *
 * Pure decision module for per-spawn internalMcp ("ouroboros") routing.
 *
 * Three outcomes:
 *   - 'direct-inject'           — write {ouroboros: <entry>} into the spawn's
 *                                 scoped MCP config (today's behavior).
 *   - 'route-through-codemode'  — omit ouroboros from the scoped config; CodeMode's
 *                                 __codemode_proxy entry already surfaces the
 *                                 graph tools as `servers.ouroboros.*` inside
 *                                 `execute_code`.
 *   - 'omit'                    — internalMcp is gated off for this spawn (scope
 *                                 'never' or task-gated + non-graph task).
 *
 * The decision is a pure function of:
 *   codemodeEnabled       — `codemode.enabled` config (Phase B added)
 *   routeInternalMcp      — `codemode.routeInternalMcp` config (Phase B added)
 *   internalMcpScope      — `internalMcpScope` from Wave 48
 *   taskNeedsGraphTools   — derived from Wave 48 goal classification (true when
 *                           task-gated would inject)
 *   transport             — `internalMcp.transport` from Phase B
 *
 * No I/O, no logger, no side effects: callers compose this with their own
 * config reads + crash-recovery downgrade. See `claudeCodeMode.ts` for the
 * place where a failed `enableCodeMode` downgrades the consumed decision back
 * to 'direct-inject'.
